                          DATE CONVERSION FUNCTIONS
                         ==========================
1)to_char():-it is used to convert oracle date type into character type.


EX:-
===
SQL> select to_char(sysdate,'dd/mm/yy')from dual;

TO_CHAR(
--------
25/08/25


SQL> select to_char(sysdate,'day')from dual;

TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'DAY')
------------------------
monday
       
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------      

1.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the 
  year 1981 from emp table using to_char()?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'YYYY')='1981';
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'YY')='81';

2.Write a query to display employee names,hiredate and 4 digit year from
  emp table by using to_char()?

EXCEPTED OUTPUT:-
===============

   ENAME      HIREDATE       YEAR
 --------    ----------     ------   
  SMITH       17-DEC-80      1980
  ALLEN       20-FEB-81      1981
  -----        -------       ----
  -----        -------       ----
  -----        -------       ----
  MILLER      23-JAN-82      1982

QUERY:
	SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'YYYY') AS YEAR FROM EMP;

3.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the month
  DECEMBER from emp table by using to_char() month format? 
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MM')='12';	
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MON')='DEC';
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'FMMONTH')='DECEMBER';

NOTE:-Whenever we are using to_char() MONTH format oracle server 
      internally allocates maximum 9 bytes for MONTH field.
whenever passed MONTH having less number of bytes then oracle server
does not return any rows.To overcome this problem then we must use
fm(fill mode).


4.Write a query to display the employees records who are joined
  in 1980,1982,1984 from emp table by using to_char()?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'YYYY') IN ('1980','1982','1984');
			OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'YYYY')='1980' OR TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'YYYY')='1982' OR TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'YYYY')='1984'; 

5.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in the 
  month FEBRUARY from emp table by using to_char() MM format ?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MM')='02';
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MON')='FEB';
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'FMMONTH')='FEBRUARY';

6.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in
  JAN,MAR,DEC months from emp table by using to_char()?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MM') IN ('01','03','12');
					OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MON') IN ('JAN','MAR','DEC');
					OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'FMMONTH') IN ('JANUARY','MARCH','DECEMBER');

7.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in 1981
  DECEMBER from emp table by using to_char()?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MM-YYYY')='12-1981';
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MONYYYY')='DEC1981';
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'FMMONTHYYYY')='DECEMBER1981';


8.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in
   1st and 4th quarter from emp table by using to_char()?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,Q) IN ('1','4');
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'Q')='1' OR TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'Q')='4';

9.Write a query to display the employees who are joining in 1981 
   1st quarter from emp table by using to_char()?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'Q')='1' AND TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'YYYY')='1981';
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'QYYYY')='11981';

10.Write a query to display employee names, DAY of join(which day
  they are join) from emp table?
QUERY:
	SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE, TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'DAY') AS HIREDAY FROM EMP;
				OR
	SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE, TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'DY') AS HIREDAY FROM EMP;

11.Write a query to display the employees who are joining 
    on SUNDAY from emp table?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'FMDAY')='SUNDAY';
				OR
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'DY')='SUN';

12.Write a query to display the employees who are joining before 
   15th of every month from emp table using to_char()?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'DD')<'15';

13.Write a query to display the employee records who are joined in 
   leap year from emp table?
QUERY:
	SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE MOD(TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'YYYY'),4)=0;

14.Write a query to display the employee records along with 
   hiredates and display the hiredates in 
   INDIA date formatt[DD/MM/YYYY]?
QUERY:
	SELECT HIREDATE, TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'DD/MM/YYYY') AS IND_FOR FROM EMP;

15.Write a query to display the employee records along with hiredates
   and display the hiredates in 
   US date formatt[MM/DD/YYYY]?
QUERY:
	SELECT HIREDATE, TO_CHAR(HIREDATE,'MM/DD/YYYY') AS US_FOR FROM EMP;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)to_date():-It is used to convert date string into 
============  oracle date type(oracle default date format)



1.Write a query which is used to display given date string into client
   requirement format using to_char() 

Given date is -> '15-JUN-05'
display format is-> '15/JUNE/05'

QUERY:
	SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('15-JUN-05'),'DD/MON/YY') FROM DUAL;

NOTE:Whenever we are using to_char() function then always first parameter 
==== must be oracle date type otherwise oracle server returns an error.



2.Write a query to find which day india got independence
QUERY:
	SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('15-08-1947','DD-MM-YYYY'),'DAY') AS INDEPENDENCE_DAY FROM DUAL;

3.Write a query which is used to add 5 days to the given date
  '09-feb-05'
QUERY:
	SELECT TO_DATE('09-feb-05')+5 FROM DUAL;

4.Write a query which is used to add 5 days to the given date
  '09-02-05'
QUERY:
	SELECT TO_DATE('09-02-05', 'DD-MM-YY') + 5 FROM DUAL;

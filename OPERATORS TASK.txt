                  1.Arithmetic operators
                  =======================

â€¢Arithmetic operators are used in number,date datatype columns.

Note:-Arithmetic operators are used in select clause. Rarely we are using
=====  in where clause.


1.Write a query to display ename, sal, annsal from emp table?
Query: SELECT ENAME, SAL, SAL * 12 AS ANNSAL FROM EMP;

2.Calculate the experience of the all employees from emp table?
Query: SELECT ENAME, HIREDATE, TRUNC((SYSDATE - HIREDATE)/365) AS EXP FROM EMP;

sysdate:-it returns current date of the system in oracle date 
=======    format.in oracle by default date format
                        is DD-MON-YY




3.Calculate TA,HRA,TAX and NETSAL from emp table based on
  following conditions?

10% on sal =>TA
20% on sal =>HRA
5% on sal  =>TAx
NETSAL=SAL+TA+HRA-TAX

[TA--->Total Allowance  HRA--->House Rent Allowances   NETSAL--->Take-home Salary]

Gross Salary includes all earnings (before deductions).

Net Salary is the actual salary received after all deductions.

Query: SELECT ENAME, SAL,
	SAL * 0.1 AS TA,
	SAL * 0.2 AS HRA,
	SAL * 0.05 AS TAX,
	SAL + SAL * 0.1 + SAL * 0.2 - SAL * 0.05 AS NETSAL FROM EMP;

4.Write a query to display the all employee salaries after 
  adding 1200 rupees?
Query:  SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,SAL + 1200 AS UPDATED_SALARY FROM EMP;

5.create the student1 table and insert the records as below.

  SNO      SNAME      SUB1         SUB2        SUB3 
  -----    -------    ------       ------      ------  
    1      GOWTHAM      72           18          24
    2       KAVYA       60           50          45
    3      PREETHI      12           30          25
    4       KIRAN       80           88          74

Query: SQL> create table STUDENT1(SNO NUMBER(5),SNAME VARCHAR2(20),SUB1 NUMBER		(20),SUB2 NUMBER(20),SUB3 NUMBER(20));

		Table created.
	SQL> INSERT INTO STUDENT1 VALUES(1,'GOWTHAM',72,18,24);
	SQL> INSERT INTO STUDENT1 VALUES(2,'KAVYA',60,50,45);
	SQL> INSERT INTO STUDENT1 VALUES(3,'PREETHI',12,30,25);
	SQL> INSERT INTO STUDENT1 VALUES(4,'KIRAN',80,88,74);

Q)Calculate the total marks of each student from the 
  student1 table?
Query: SQL> SELECT SNO,SNAME,(SUB1+SUB2+SUB3) AS TOTAL_MARKS FROM STUDENT1;

Q)Calculate the average marks of student from the
  student1 table?
Query: SQL> SELECT SNO,SNAME,(SUB1+SUB2+SUB3) AS TOTAL_MARKS, ROUND	((SUB1+SUB2+SUB3)/3.0,2)AS AVG_MARKS FROM STUDENT1;
